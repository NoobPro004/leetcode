 *
 * An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2,
 * 3, and 5.
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are
 * limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 14
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 *
