 *
 * Given a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have
 * the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these
 * substrings are grouped consecutively.
 * 
 * Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they
 * occur.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "00110011"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive
 * 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
 * Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of
 * times they occur.
 * Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are
 * not grouped together.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "10101"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal
 * number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
